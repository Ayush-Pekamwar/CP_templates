POINTS TO BE NOTED
- In C/C++, truncate division is used to determine the remainder
SO USE THIS : (a%b + b)%b ; 
(In programming languages which uses truncate divison to find the remainder, we always find remainder as (a%b + b)%b (add quotient to remainder and again take remainder) to avoid negative remainder and get the correct result.)
